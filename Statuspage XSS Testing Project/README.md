# Statuspage XSS Testing Project

Welcome to my **Statuspage XSS Testing Project** repository! This project demonstrates a structured approach to identifying and documenting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the **Statuspage** platform.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside?
This folder contains all the key files and resources used in this project. Here's a breakdown of each file and what it includes:

- **`README.md`**: You're reading it now! This file provides an overview of the project, the file structure, and guidance on navigating the repository.
- **`payloads.txt`**: A collection of XSS payloads crafted and tested during this project. These payloads highlight different ways XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- **`report.txt`**: A detailed report summarizing the findings, including the vulnerabilities identified, the testing process, and recommendations for mitigation.
- **`screenshots/`**: A folder containing screenshots taken during the testing process. These images illustrate the vulnerabilities in action and provide visual evidence of their impact.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To dive deeper into the project and see the technical details, start with the [`payloads.txt`](payloads.txt) file. It contains the actual payloads used and their context within the testing process.

Once you're familiar with the payloads, move on to [`report.txt`](report.txt) for a detailed explanation of the findings and recommendations.

For a visual representation, feel free to explore the `screenshots` folder.

## ðŸ›‘ Ethical Disclaimer
All testing in this project was conducted **ethically** and with the **explicit prior approval** of the relevant stakeholders. This project aims to promote security awareness and responsible disclosure practices.
