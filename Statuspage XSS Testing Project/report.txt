# Detailed Report: XSS Vulnerabilities on Statuspage

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities identified during testing on the **Statuspage** platform. It includes the methodology, findings, and recommendations to mitigate the vulnerabilities.

---

## üõ† Testing Methodology
```markdown
1. **Setup:**
   - Configured **Burp Suite** to intercept HTTP requests and responses.
   - Used browser Developer Tools to inspect and modify DOM elements in real-time.

2. **Targets:**
   - Input fields, buttons, dropdown menus, and attributes such as `id` and `onclick`.

3. **Payloads:**
   - Designed XSS payloads to test input validation and output encoding.

4. **Process:**
   - Injected payloads into various components and observed responses.
   - Documented vulnerabilities based on execution of malicious scripts.
```

---

## üîç Findings and Analysis
### 1. Customization Page
```markdown
- **Issue:** Vulnerable `<input>` fields allow XSS injection.
- **Payload Used:**
  ```html
  <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
  ```
- **Impact:** JavaScript code execution upon saving customizations.
- **Risk:** High ‚Äì Exploitable by attackers to inject malicious scripts.
```

---

### 2. Plan Selection Page
```markdown
- **Issue:** Dropdown menus and buttons vulnerable to XSS.
- **Payloads Used:**
  ```html
  <script>alert('XSS via dropdown')</script>
  ```
  ```html
  onclick="alert('XSS via button')"
  ```
- **Impact:** JavaScript execution upon user interaction with dropdowns or buttons.
- **Risk:** Medium ‚Äì User interaction required for exploitation.
```

---

### 3. Incidents Page
```markdown
- **Issue:** `<img>` tags, buttons, and the search component allow XSS.
- **Payloads Used:**
  ```html
  <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS via img')>
  ```
  ```html
  onclick="alert('XSS via Create Incident button')"
  ```
- **Impact:** Multiple entry points for malicious script execution.
- **Risk:** High ‚Äì Exploitable by attackers to compromise user accounts or sessions.
```

---

### 4. Upload Image Feature
```markdown
- **Issue:** The `id` attribute can be exploited for XSS.
- **Payload Used:**
  ```html
  id="test" onclick="alert('XSS via id attribute')"
  ```
- **Impact:** Arbitrary script execution through modified DOM attributes.
- **Risk:** Medium ‚Äì Requires user interaction or crafted requests.
```

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
### General Mitigation Strategies
```markdown
1. **Input Validation:**
   - Sanitize all user inputs on both client and server sides.
   - Reject or escape potentially malicious characters.

2. **Output Encoding:**
   - Use libraries like **OWASP Java Encoder** to safely render user-generated content.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
   - Enforce a CSP to limit the sources of executable scripts.

4. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Conduct periodic penetration tests to identify and address new vulnerabilities.

5. **Developer Training:**
   - Provide training on secure coding practices, focusing on input validation and output encoding.
```

### Specific Recommendations for Findings
```markdown
1. **Customization Page:**
   - Apply server-side input validation and escape all user-generated content before rendering.

2. **Plan Selection Page:**
   - Restrict dropdown inputs to predefined options.
   - Sanitize attributes like `onclick` to prevent JavaScript execution.

3. **Incidents Page:**
   - Use a CSP to block inline scripts.
   - Encode all user-generated content rendered in `<img>` tags or buttons.

4. **Upload Image Feature:**
   - Validate and sanitize attribute values for DOM elements.
   - Block attributes like `onclick` unless explicitly needed.
