# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity portfolio!  
This repository showcases my work in vulnerability research and penetration testing, as well as areas I am actively learning and exploring.

## Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder within this repository.  
Every folder includes:
- A README file that explains the project.
- Supporting files like scripts, reports, or screenshots.

## About Me
I specialize in vulnerability research and penetration testing, with a focus on identifying and mitigating web vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL Injection, and CSRF.  
My expertise includes utilizing tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, and Metasploit to analyze and secure web applications and systems.

I am passionate about continuously expanding my knowledge in cybersecurity. My areas of interest include advanced exploitation techniques, server-side vulnerabilities, mobile application security, and other emerging challenges in the field.  
I strive to stay updated with the latest trends and apply innovative solutions to improve security.

## Posts on SecurePulses
I write accessible cybersecurity posts on [SecurePulses](https://securepulses.com), focusing on helping individuals without a technical background understand how to protect themselves in various situations.
