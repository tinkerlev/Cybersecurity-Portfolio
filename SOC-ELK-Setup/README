# ELK SOC Project

üëã Welcome to my ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) project!  
This project highlights my experience in setting up and managing an ELK stack as part of a SOC environment. Here, I'll share the process, challenges, and lessons learned.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Overview
In this project, I worked on creating a centralized SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system using the ELK stack. The goal was to collect, analyze, and visualize security logs from various sources to improve threat detection and response.

---

## üîß What I Did
1. **ELK Stack Installation**:
   - Installed and configured ELK on a local network (LAN).
   - Set up static IP, DNS, and network settings for seamless communication.

2. **System Integration**:
   - Connected a Linux server and a Windows client to the ELK stack.
   - Installed and configured agents (like Sysmon) for log collection on endpoints.

3. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Integrated pfSense with the ELK stack to forward logs and monitor network activity.
   - Configured rules to ensure proper traffic flow and security.

4. **Log Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Used Kibana to analyze and visualize logs.
   - Created filters to identify failed login attempts, suspicious activities, and network anomalies.

## üìö Lessons Learned
- **Technical Skills**:
  - Setting up and configuring ELK in a real-world scenario.
  - Integrating multiple systems into a unified platform for better visibility.
  - Creating effective filters and searches in Kibana to pinpoint specific events.

- **Problem-Solving**:
  - Troubleshooting DNS and network connectivity issues.
  - Adjusting firewall rules to balance security and functionality.

- **Understanding Data**:
  - Gaining insights into how logs tell a story about network activity.
  - Learning to identify patterns and anomalies in security events.

## üöÄ Why This Matters
This project not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of how SOC environments operate. It's a perfect example of how technology can be used to enhance security and visibility in an organization.
