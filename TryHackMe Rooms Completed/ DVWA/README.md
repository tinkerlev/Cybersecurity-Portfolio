# DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)

## ðŸŒŸ Room Overview
- **Platform:** TryHackMe
- **Focus Area:** Web Application Security
- **Key Tools/Concepts Learned:** Exploiting common web vulnerabilities, understanding their impact, and learning how to mitigate them.

---

## ðŸ›  Key Objectives
1. Explore common web vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and Command Injection.
2. Understand the practical impact of these vulnerabilities on web applications.
3. Practice exploiting vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
4. Learn mitigation techniques to secure web applications against these attacks.

---

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- **SQL Injection:** How attackers manipulate queries to access or modify database information.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts to execute in a user's browser.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Exploiting user trust in web applications to execute unauthorized actions.
- **Command Injection:** Leveraging input fields to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- The importance of securing user inputs through input validation, sanitization, and proper encoding.
- How to use tools like Burp Suite to analyze and manipulate web requests.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Burp Suite:** For intercepting and manipulating web traffic.
- **OWASP ZAP:** For automated scanning and vulnerability identification.
- **Browser Developer Tools:** For analyzing HTML, JavaScript, and network requests.
- **SQLMap:** For automating SQL Injection testing.

---

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
1. Understanding how to construct effective payloads for exploiting vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS.
2. Learning how to bypass input validation and identify poorly secured endpoints.
3. Adapting mitigation techniques to different types of vulnerabilities.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways
- **Web Security is Critical:** Many applications are vulnerable to simple attacks due to improper input handling.
- **Exploitation Demonstrates Impact:** Understanding the real-world impact of vulnerabilities helps prioritize remediation.
- **Mitigation Techniques:** Use parameterized queries, implement Content Security Policies (CSPs), and validate all user inputs.
- **Hands-On Practice is Key:** Tools like DVWA provide a safe environment to practice and understand vulnerabilities.
