# Cryptography for Dummies

## ðŸŒŸ Room Overview
- **Platform:** TryHackMe
- **Focus Area:** Cryptography Basics
- **Key Tools/Concepts Learned:** Understanding cryptographic concepts, encryption, decryption, and common ciphers.

---

## ðŸ›  Key Objectives
1. Learn the foundational principles of cryptography.
2. Understand the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
3. Explore common cryptographic ciphers and how they are used.
4. Practice encrypting and decrypting messages using tools and techniques.

---

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- **Symmetric Encryption:**
  - Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
  - Examples: AES, DES.
- **Asymmetric Encryption:**
  - Utilizes a pair of keys: public and private.
  - Examples: RSA, ECC.
- **Common Ciphers:**
  - **Caesar Cipher:** A substitution cipher that shifts letters by a fixed number.
  - **VigenÃ¨re Cipher:** A more complex cipher using a keyword for encryption.
  - **Base64 Encoding:** A method of encoding binary data into text.
- **Hash Functions:** One-way cryptographic algorithms like MD5, SHA1, and SHA256.
- Practical applications of cryptography in securing communications, protecting data, and verifying integrity.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **CyberChef:** A powerful tool for encoding, decoding, and cryptographic operations.
- **Python Scripts:** For automating encryption and decryption tasks.
- **Hashcat/John the Ripper:** For cracking hashed passwords.
- **GPG:** For encrypting and signing files.

---

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
1. Understanding the mathematical principles behind asymmetric encryption.
2. Decoding complex ciphers without prior knowledge of the key.
3. Differentiating between encoding, encryption, and hashing.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways
- **Cryptography is Everywhere:** It secures communications, protects data, and ensures trust in digital interactions.
- **Choose the Right Tool:** Symmetric encryption is faster, while asymmetric encryption provides better security for key exchange.
- **Practice Builds Proficiency:** Regularly working with ciphers and cryptographic tools enhances understanding.
- **Think Like an Attacker:** Understanding cryptographic weaknesses helps identify potential vulnerabilities.
