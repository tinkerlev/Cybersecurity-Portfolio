# Red Team Engagements

## ðŸŒŸ Room Overview
- **Platform:** TryHackMe
- **Focus Area:** Advanced Red Teaming Techniques
- **Key Tools/Concepts Learned:** Planning and executing red team operations, reporting, and working collaboratively with blue teams.

---

## ðŸ›  Key Objectives
1. Understand the lifecycle of a red team engagement from planning to reporting.
2. Learn how to simulate real-world adversaries to test organizational defenses.
3. Gain insights into developing and executing stealthy attack techniques.
4. Explore effective communication with stakeholders and collaboration with blue teams.

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- **Red Team Engagement Lifecycle:**
  - **Planning:** Establishing goals, scope, and rules of engagement (ROE).
  - **Execution:** Conducting reconnaissance, exploitation, and lateral movement.
  - **Post-Exploitation:** Achieving objectives like data exfiltration or privilege escalation.
  - **Reporting:** Documenting findings and providing actionable recommendations.
- The importance of aligning red team objectives with organizational goals.
- **Blue Team Collaboration:** Red team findings are critical for helping blue teams improve their detection and response strategies.
- How to use tools and frameworks to simulate advanced attack techniques:
  - **Cobalt Strike** for command-and-control operations.
  - **PowerShell** for post-exploitation activities.
  - **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** for mapping tactics and techniques.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Cobalt Strike:** For adversary emulation and C2 operations.
- **PowerShell:** For executing advanced post-exploitation techniques.
- **BloodHound:** For mapping Active Directory environments.
- **Nmap:** For reconnaissance and network mapping.
- **Metasploit Framework:** For exploiting vulnerabilities.

---

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
1. Maintaining stealth during simulated attacks while achieving engagement objectives.
2. Adapting attack techniques to bypass detection mechanisms like firewalls and antivirus software.
3. Effectively communicating technical findings to non-technical stakeholders in reports.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways
- **Planning is Crucial:** A well-defined scope and clear rules of engagement are essential for successful red team operations.
- **Stealth vs. Impact:** Balancing operational security (OpSec) with achieving engagement goals is a core red team skill.
- **Collaboration Drives Improvement:** Red team engagements are most effective when findings are shared transparently with blue teams.
- **Mapping to Frameworks:** Using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK provides consistency in describing tactics and techniques.
