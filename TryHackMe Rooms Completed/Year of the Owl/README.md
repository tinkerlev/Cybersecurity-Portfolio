## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- **Reconnaissance and Enumeration:**
  - Using tools like Nmap and Gobuster to identify open ports, services, and hidden directories.
  - Collecting hints and clues from banners, file metadata, and other sources.
- **Exploitation Techniques:**
  - Exploiting misconfigured services and web applications.
  - Leveraging custom payloads to bypass filters and gain access.
- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - Enumerating system details and exploiting weak permissions to elevate privileges.
  - Utilizing common scripts like LinPEAS for automated enumeration.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:**
  - Applying critical thinking to piece together information and solve multi-step challenges.
  - Managing time and prioritizing tasks to achieve objectives effectively.
