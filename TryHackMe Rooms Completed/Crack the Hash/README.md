## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- **Hash Basics:**
  - Cryptographic hashes are used for integrity verification and secure storage of passwords.
  - Hashes are one-way functions, making them difficult to reverse.
- **Hash Identification:**
  - Identifying hash types like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and NTLM based on their length and format.
- **Cracking Techniques:**
  - Dictionary Attacks: Using wordlists to guess passwords.
  - Brute Force: Trying all possible combinations within a character set.
  - Rainbow Tables: Precomputed hash values for common passwords.
- **Optimization Tips:**
  - Using GPU-based tools for faster cracking.
  - Leveraging rule-based attacks to expand wordlists.
