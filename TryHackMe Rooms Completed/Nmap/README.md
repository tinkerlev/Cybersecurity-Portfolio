# Nmap

## ðŸŒŸ Room Overview
- **Platform:** TryHackMe
- **Focus Area:** Network Scanning and Enumeration
- **Key Tools/Concepts Learned:** Using Nmap to scan networks, identify open ports, and gather system information.

---

## ðŸ›  Key Objectives
1. Learn how to perform basic and advanced network scans using Nmap.
2. Understand the different scan types and their purposes.
3. Explore options for detecting operating systems, services, and versions.
4. Practice identifying potential vulnerabilities based on open ports and services.

---

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- **Types of Nmap Scans:**
  - **SYN Scan (-sS):** A fast and stealthy scan that identifies open ports.
  - **Service Version Scan (-sV):** Determines the version of services running on open ports.
  - **Operating System Detection (-O):** Attempts to identify the target's OS.
  - **Aggressive Scan (-A):** Combines multiple options for detailed enumeration.
- **Scan Output Formats:**
  - **Normal (-oN):** Human-readable format.
  - **XML (-oX):** For automated parsing.
  - **Grepable (-oG):** Useful for custom scripts and further analysis.
- How to identify common vulnerabilities based on services and versions detected.
- The importance of responsible scanning and adhering to rules of engagement in real-world scenarios.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Nmap:** The primary tool for network scanning and enumeration.
- **Zenmap:** A graphical interface for Nmap, providing an easier way to visualize scan results.
- **Grep:** For extracting specific information from Nmap scan outputs.

---

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
1. Understanding the purpose and use cases for different scan types.
2. Learning how to interpret complex Nmap outputs and identify actionable information.
3. Using Nmap scripts (NSE - Nmap Scripting Engine) to enhance scanning capabilities.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways
- **Network Scanning is Foundational:** Identifying open ports and services is the first step in penetration testing.
- **Scan Types Matter:** Each scan type has its strengths and weaknesses; choose based on the context.
- **NSE Scripts Enhance Nmap:** Scripts like `vuln` and `http-enum` provide additional insights into vulnerabilities and services.
- **Documentation is Critical:** Always save scan outputs in multiple formats for future reference.
