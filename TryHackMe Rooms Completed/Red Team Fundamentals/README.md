# Red Team Fundamentals

## ðŸŒŸ Room Overview
- **Platform:** TryHackMe
- **Focus Area:** Offensive Security > Red Teaming Basics
- **Key Tools/Concepts Learned:** Understanding the red team methodology, attack lifecycle, and emulating adversarial behavior.

---

## ðŸ›  Key Objectives
1. Learn the fundamentals of red teaming and its role in cybersecurity.
2. Understand the attack lifecycle, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation.
3. Explore how red teams emulate real-world adversaries to test an organization's defenses.
4. Gain insight into common tools and techniques used in red team engagements.

---

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- **Red Team vs. Penetration Testing:** Red teaming focuses on emulating real-world threats and testing detection and response capabilities, whereas penetration testing focuses on identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Attack Lifecycle:**
  - **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the target.
  - **Initial Access:** Gaining a foothold through vulnerabilities or social engineering.
  - **Lateral Movement:** Expanding access within the environment.
  - **Exfiltration:** Stealing data or demonstrating the attack's impact.
- **Common Tools:**
  - Using tools like Metasploit and Cobalt Strike for exploitation and post-exploitation.
  - PowerShell for executing scripts and automating attacks.
- The importance of **opsec (Operational Security)** to avoid detection during red team engagements.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Metasploit Framework:** For exploitation and lateral movement.
- **Cobalt Strike:** For adversary simulation and command-and-control (C2).
- **Nmap:** For network scanning and reconnaissance.
- **PowerShell:** For executing post-exploitation tasks.

---

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
1. Balancing stealth and impact: Ensuring actions mimic realistic threats without detection.
2. Learning how to map the attack lifecycle to real-world scenarios.
3. Understanding the importance of reporting findings effectively to improve defenses.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways
- **Adversary Emulation is Key:** Red teams aim to simulate realistic threats, helping organizations identify gaps in their detection and response capabilities.
- **OpSec is Critical:** Maintaining operational security is essential for successful red team engagements.
- **Collaboration with Blue Teams:** Red team engagements aren't just about attacking; they help blue teams strengthen their defenses.
- **Tools and Creativity:** While tools are essential, understanding how to adapt techniques to bypass defenses is just as important.
