# Windows PrivEsc Arena

## ðŸŒŸ Room Overview
- **Platform:** TryHackMe
- **Focus Area:** Windows Privilege Escalation
- **Key Tools/Concepts Learned:** Identifying and exploiting privilege escalation vectors on Windows systems.

---

## ðŸ›  Key Objectives
1. Understand the fundamentals of privilege escalation on Windows systems.
2. Identify common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that can be exploited for privilege escalation.
3. Explore tools and techniques to enumerate system information and identify potential attack vectors.
4. Practice exploiting privilege escalation vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

---

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- **Key Privilege Escalation Techniques:**
  - Exploiting misconfigured services and permissions.
  - Abusing scheduled tasks and unquoted service paths.
  - Exploiting vulnerable software and outdated patches.
  - Leveraging hardcoded credentials and insecure file permissions.
- **Enumeration Techniques:**
  - Gathering detailed system information such as user accounts, processes, and installed software.
  - Identifying potential privilege escalation vectors through automated tools and manual analysis.
- The importance of understanding Windows-specific vulnerabilities like:
  - Weak registry permissions.
  - Insecure service configurations.
  - Vulnerable binaries.
- Best practices for mitigating privilege escalation risks, including securing sensitive files and keeping systems up-to-date.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **WinPEAS:** For automated privilege escalation enumeration.
- **PowerUp:** A PowerShell script for identifying common privilege escalation vectors.
- **Windows Exploit Suggester:** For identifying exploitable vulnerabilities based on system patches.
- **Process Explorer:** For analyzing running processes and their permissions.
- **Metasploit:** For automating privilege escalation exploits.

---

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
1. Understanding the output of enumeration tools and mapping findings to potential exploits.
2. Exploiting unquoted service paths and ensuring persistence after exploitation.
3. Differentiating between theoretical attack vectors and practical, exploitable ones.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways
- **Enumeration is Critical:** Comprehensive enumeration is the first step in identifying privilege escalation opportunities.
- **Windows Systems Have Unique Challenges:** Privilege escalation on Windows often involves understanding system-specific misconfigurations.
- **Mitigation is Key:** Securing services, files, and registry permissions can prevent many privilege escalation attacks.
- **Tools Save Time:** Tools like WinPEAS and PowerUp make it easier to identify common issues, but manual validation is crucial.
